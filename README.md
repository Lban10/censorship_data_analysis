## Project Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis report on the political affiliations and types of book bans in states identified as censorship states. The analysis uses the PEN America dataset to compare various factors related to censorship in the United States. The project aims to shed light on the political dynamics surrounding book bans and their implications for information access.

## Dataset
The primary dataset used in this analysis comes from PEN America, which tracks instances of book bans across the United States. This dataset includes information about:
- Titles of banned books
- Political affiliations of states
- Types of bans (e.g., complete bans, restricted access)
- Demographic data related to the states

For more detailed insights, you can download the latest report from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Lban10/censorship_data_analysis/releases).

## Analysis Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are:
1. To identify patterns in book bans based on political affiliations.
2. To categorize the types of bans implemented across different states.
3. To analyze the impact of these bans on libraries and information access.
4. To provide actionable insights for policymakers and advocacy groups.

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from the PEN America dataset, focusing on key variables.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to identify correlations between political affiliations and types of bans.
4. **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the data to highlight key findings.

### Tools Used
- Python for data analysis
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for documenting the analysis process

## Results
The results of the analysis reveal significant correlations between political affiliations and the types of book bans. Key findings include:
- States with more conservative political affiliations tend to implement stricter bans.
- Certain genres and topics are more frequently targeted for bans.
- Demographic factors also play a role in the prevalence of book bans.

Visualizations will be included in the report to illustrate these findings clearly.
